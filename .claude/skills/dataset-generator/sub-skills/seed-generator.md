## Goal

Create or normalize draft records into the fixed canonical schema.

## Operating modes

### Topic-driven generation

**Research-first, synthesize-second (mandatory):**

Before drafting any synthetic record, the agent must research real-world material first:

1. **Search and collect real examples.** Use the IDE's browsing, search, and file-reading tools to find real-world instances of the target domain: forum posts, bug reports, documentation snippets, GitHub issues, StackOverflow threads, real conversation logs, CVE entries, or any authentic source relevant to the topic.
2. **Ground each record in a real scenario.** Every seed record should be traceable to a plausible real-world situation. Do not write abstract instructions like "Create example N for topic X." Instead, write instructions that a real user would actually type in a real tool.
3. **Use synthesis only for gap-filling.** After exhausting real-world sources, use synthesis to fill taxonomy buckets that have zero real-world coverage. Tag these with `metadata.source_origin: "synthetic"` and real-sourced ones with `metadata.source_origin: "real_world"`.
4. **Target ratio:** aim for at least 60% real-world-grounded records. If you cannot reach 60%, document why in the data card.

- Spread examples across taxonomy, persona, and difficulty.
- Keep records concrete and non-redundant.
- Unless the user specifies otherwise, target `500` total records.
- For large targets, generate in batches and keep going until the planned **effective** count is reached after duplicate suppression.
- Do not stop after a small starter set unless the user explicitly asked for a prototype or sample.

**Multi-constraint prompts (mandatory):** Every seed instruction must carry at least 2–3 explicit constraints, for example:
  - A *negative constraint*: "do not use the `requests` library", "avoid any markdown formatting"
  - A *format constraint*: "return only valid JSON", "respond in exactly 3 bullet points"
  - A *scoping constraint*: "assume the user is using Python 3.11", "the environment has no internet access"

Instructions with zero constraints are too easy and produce no fine-tuning signal. Re-draft them before writing the record.

**Blind Contexts / Information Asymmetry:** Ensure `<context>` blocks contain only raw, realistic inputs. Never leak the root cause, vulnerability mechanism, or explicit hints into the context before the assistant is forced to deduce it.
If structured labels or mechanism fields must be retained for audit or analytics, keep them in metadata and plan to hide them from model-visible `instruction`/`context` with `model_visibility` during export instead of spelling them out in the prompt itself.

**Human imperfection injection (mandatory):**

Real users do not write perfectly formatted prompts. To avoid training a model that only responds well to polished inputs, deliberately vary instruction quality:

- **Typos and abbreviations** (10–15% of records): "pls check if vuln", "whats the issue w/ this func", "how do i fix teh error"
- **Incomplete context** (10–15%): truncated logs, missing HTTP headers, partial stack traces, redacted credentials
- **Ambiguous instructions** (5–10%): instructions that could be interpreted multiple ways, forcing the response to either clarify or make a stated assumption
- **Mixed formality** (spread across all): casual Slack-style messages, formal tickets, terse CLI-style one-liners, verbose newcomer questions
- **Copy-paste artifacts** (5%): extra whitespace, stray line numbers, terminal prompts left in, markdown that didn't render

Tag records with `metadata.instruction_fidelity` using values: `"polished"`, `"casual"`, `"messy"`, `"ambiguous"`.

**Response architecture variety (mandatory):**

Do not let every response follow the same skeleton. Force fundamentally different response shapes:

- **Concise direct answers** (15–25%): 1–3 sentences, no preamble, no steps.
- **Detailed walkthroughs** (20–30%): multi-paragraph with code, explanations, and caveats.
- **Socratic pushback** (5–10%): the expert questions the premise, asks for clarification, or explains why the question is wrong before answering.
- **Code-first responses** (10–20%): the response leads with code and follows with a brief explanation.
- **Disagreement or uncertainty** (5%): the expert says "I need more information" or "this depends on X" and explains why a single answer isn't possible.
- **Step-by-step reasoning with `<think>` blocks** (20–40% for reasoning tasks): but vary the depth and structure of the trace itself.

Tag records with `metadata.response_shape` using values: `"concise"`, `"walkthrough"`, `"socratic"`, `"code_first"`, `"uncertain"`, `"cot"`.

When the outer contract must stay structurally fixed, vary the internal answer family anyway. Tag `metadata.response_family` with values such as `"verdict_first"`, `"evidence_first"`, `"fix_first"`, `"triage_first"`, or `"uncertain"` so coverage can detect template collapse even when the top-level JSON shape stays the same.

**Coverage metadata (mandatory for large or specialized datasets):**

To make generation steerable, annotate each record with the fields the coverage plan will track. At minimum, populate:

- `metadata.subtopic`
- `metadata.intent`
- `metadata.response_shape`
- `metadata.instruction_fidelity`
- `metadata.source_origin`
- `metadata.response_family` when the response contract is structurally fixed or highly repetitive

For specialized classification corpora, also populate:

- `metadata.context_type`
- `metadata.label`

Do not leave these to inference later. If the metadata is missing, the coverage script cannot tell what to generate next.
If a record is marked `metadata.source_origin: "real_world"`, include traceable provenance such as `metadata.reference_urls`, `metadata.source_path`, or `source_uri`.
If `metadata.source_origin` is omitted, the pipeline now infers a fallback (`synthetic` for generated drafts, `real_world` for URL/research imports, `unknown` for raw datasets), but explicit provenance is still preferred.
When those metadata fields are answer-bearing, preserve them in metadata but avoid mirroring them in prompt text. Use the coverage plan's `model_visibility` section to strip or redact them from exported `instruction` and `context`.

**Anti-trope guardrails:** Before finalising any response, scan for and remove:
  - Opening preambles: "As an AI…", "Certainly!", "Of course!", "Here is…", "Sure, here's…", "In summary"
  - Self-referential hedges: "As a language model…", "I should note that…"
  - Filler closings: "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if you need anything else."

Drop these entirely. The response should start with the actual content.

### URL or reference-material structuring

- Use available browsing, file-reading, and search tools in the IDE.
- Extract facts, examples, or source passages.
- Convert them into canonical records instead of copying raw source dumps.
- If the user does not specify size, aim for `500` structured records by default.

### Existing dataset normalization

- Map source columns into canonical fields.
- Preserve provenance in metadata.
- Keep the source URI/path when available.
- Preserve as much of the usable dataset size as possible unless the user asks for sampling.

## Output path

Write draft records to a JSONL file, then load them with:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate.py --input <drafts.jsonl> --source-type <generated|url_reference|raw_dataset|internet_research> --tool-context <codex|claude|antigravity>
```

The imported drafts will enter the pipeline as `raw_generated` records unless they still contain explicit placeholder responses, in which case they remain `seeded`.
For active generation runs, import with `--dedup-threshold 0.85` so near-duplicates are rejected before they distort the raw count.

For red-team, security, pentest, jailbreak, or prompt-injection datasets, treat injection-tolerant import as the default. Add `--enforce-security-flags` only when you want those payloads flagged instead of preserved.

## Required metadata

Each canonical record should carry enough metadata for later export and audit:

- `difficulty`
- `persona`
- `source_type`
- `subtopic`
- `intent`
- `response_shape`
- `response_family`
- `instruction_fidelity`
- `source_origin`
- optional provenance such as `reference_urls`, tags, source path, or notes

For untrusted imports and web-derived material, also inspect:

- `metadata.security_flags`
- `metadata.requires_manual_review`

## Multi-turn conversation records

For agentic workflows (Claude Code, Antigravity, tool-use), single-turn records are insufficient. Use the following encoding for multi-turn conversations:

- `context`: the full conversation history up to (but not including) the final user turn, formatted as alternating `User:` / `Assistant:` blocks.
- `instruction`: the final user turn (the message the model must respond to).
- `response.text`: the ideal assistant response for that final turn.

Examples of when to use multi-turn records:
- Tool-use sequences where the model must call a tool and incorporate its result.
- Clarification dialogues where the model asks a follow-up before answering.
- Agentic tasks that require re-planning mid-conversation.

Tag these records with `metadata.format: "multi_turn"`.

## Chain-of-thought & reasoning traces

For code tasks, math, logic puzzles, and planning problems include a reasoning trace before the final answer. Use this format in `response.text`:

```
<think>
Step-by-step reasoning here...
</think>

Final answer or code here.
```

Use `metadata.reasoning_style: "chain_of_thought"` when a reasoning trace is present, and `"direct"` when the response is a straight answer. Aim for a mix — roughly 40–60% chain-of-thought for code/reasoning tasks, 10–20% for factual/retrieval tasks.

## Seed-only fallback

If you only need placeholder slots before writing full examples:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate.py --topic "<topic>" [--count <n>] --task-type <sft|dpo>
```

If `--count` is omitted, the placeholder target defaults to `500`.

## Evidence-linked records

When using `scripts/research.py`, draft records from `evidence.jsonl` and preserve traceability:

- `metadata.evidence_ids`: evidence chunk IDs used to create the record
- `metadata.reference_urls`: source URLs used
- `metadata.source_domain`: domain or `local`
- `metadata.source_quality_score`: source score from research
- `source_uri`: primary source URL/path

When drafting records from `evidence.jsonl`, copy `metadata.scenario_fingerprint` from the evidence row into the canonical record's metadata. This prevents split leakage by ensuring all records derived from the same evidence cluster receive the same cluster key, so they land together in the same train or test split rather than being scattered across both.

Do not place answer-bearing labels or mechanisms in model-visible `instruction` or `context`; keep them in metadata and use `model_visibility` during export.
